# MobWeb_CategoryLinksInLayeredNavigation extension for Magento

A simple Magento extension that replaces the category filters in the layered navigation with actual links to these categories. So if a customer is viewing a parent category and clicks on the filter for the child category, they are taken directly to that child category's overview page.

## Installation

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
